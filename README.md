# ATLAS
code for the paper " Nonlinear model reduction for slow-fast stochastic systems near  manifolds" by Felix X.-F. Ye, Sichen Yang, Mauro Maggioni. 

The paper contains results for three example problems based on Pinched sphere(nick name: peanut), Oscillating half-moons and Butane model. Code for each example can be found in the respective subfolder in the examples folder.

In each example, there are two steps. The first is the ATLAS learning stage and the second is the mean resident time simulating stage.
